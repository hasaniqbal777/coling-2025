### Bio:
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 0.8em;">
Katrin Erk is a Professor of Linguistics and Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. She earned her Ph.D. from Saarland University in Germany in 2002, focusing on tree description languages and ellipsis. Her research expertise lies in computational linguistics, particularly in semantics. She specializes in developing distributed, flexible approaches to describing word meaning and integrating them with representations at the sentence or discourse level. Her work includes studying flexible representations of word meaning constrained by context and exploring frameworks that draw inferences based on sentence structure and word meanings. She also investigates narrative schemas and their influence on word meaning and inference. In October 2024, it was announced that she will join the University of Massachusetts Amherst in September 2025, holding a joint position in the Department of Linguistics and the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences. Throughout her career, she has received several awards and honors, including a CSLI Fellowship at Stanford in 2017 and a Google Faculty Research Award in 2018.

### Bio:
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 0.8em;">
Emmanuel Dupoux is a Professor of Cognitive Psychology at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) in Paris. He earned his Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from EHESS in 1989, focusing on the mechanisms and representations that enable infants to acquire language and become cognitively functional within their culture. His research expertise lies in cognitive development, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, cognitive modeling, and machine learning. He specializes in studying early language acquisition, phonological ‘deafnesses’ in speech perception, and the development of social cognition. He also investigates how machine learning and artificial intelligence can provide quantitative models of processing and learning in infants. Throughout his career, he has received several awards and honors, including an Advanced ERC grant and the organization of the Zero Resource Speech Challenge (2015, 2017, 2019) and the Intuitive Physics Benchmark (2019).
