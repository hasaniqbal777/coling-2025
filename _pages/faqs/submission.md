## General Questions

### Is it permissible for an author to be listed on multiple papers submitted to the conference?

Yes. However, it may be the case that different authors need to register to present multiple papers (the registration policy has not been decided yet).

### Will all accepted papers be indexed/included in the conference proceedings?

Yes. All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings.

## ARR papers and commitment to COLING

### If a paper has been reviewed by ARR in June and has not been committed to any conference, can it be submitted directly to COLING 2025 in September.

If the paper is not under review on ARR in September, it can be submitted to COLING on September 16. Please note, if you want to submit a previously reviewed ARR paper to COLING, you must not submit it to the ARR August deadline, otherwise the paper would be under review at two different venues, which is not allowed.

### If I have a paper that has been reviewed by different rounds of ARR, do I have to use the latest ARR review for commitment to COLING 2025, or can I choose to commit the reviews from a previous round?

You need to use reviews from the latest round for commitment.

### Can a paper that has been committed to EMNLP 2024 (through ARR) be directly submitted to COLING 2025 in September?

No. However, ARR papers committed to EMNLP, which were not accepted for EMNLP, can be committed to COLING on October 20.
