## General Questions

### Is it permissible for an author to be listed on multiple papers submitted to the conference?

### Will all accepted papers be indexed/included in the conference proceedings?

**Yes**. All accepted papers will be indexed/included in the conference proceedings.

## Direct Submission to COLING 2025

### If a paper has been reviewed by ARR in June and has not been committed to any conference, can it be submitted directly to COLING 2025 in September?

**Yes**. If the paper is not under review on ARR or some other venue on <u>September 16</u>, it can be submitted to COLING 2025 through START.

### Can papers submitted to the ARR August deadline be submitted to COLING 2025 in September?

**No**. Papers submitted to the ARR August deadline must not be submitted to COLING 2025 through START on <u>September 16</u>, because they will still be under review on ARR by that time.

### Can a paper that has been committed to EMNLP 2024 (through ARR) be directly submitted to COLING 2025 through START by September 16?
