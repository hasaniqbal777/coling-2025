<small>We plan on updating the FAQ continuously</small>

### Is there a onsite poster printing service service available?

Please check [this page](/participants-info/#poster-orders) for information on poster ordering.

### What facilities do we have for the in-person demo session?

As the Demo Call for Papers notes for in-person presentations, we expect at least one of the authors to present a live demo during a demo session at COLING 2025, with an accompanying poster. There will be a desk and monitor with HDMI cable available for the demo, and a poster board for a A0-sized poster.

### I am author of a paper that was assigned an oral presentation. Do I also need to prepare a poster?

No. There will be no (virtual or in-person) posters for papers that have been assigned an oral presentation. The authors of these papers only need to prepare their talk.

### Are travel fellowships or conference fee waivers available for attending COLING 2025?

Unfortunately, no travel fellowships are available for attending Coling2025, including waivers of the registration fee.  If you are unable to attend in person, please consider attending only the virtual portion of the conference.
