### Should I follow certain customs when visiting?

While the UAE is an Islamic country, its culture is shaped by the large number of expats from all over the globe (90% of the population from 150+ nationalities). That said, discretion and modest behavior in public spaces are generally expected. Public displays of affection between couples of all orientations and genders are generally discouraged.

### Can I drink alcohol in the UAE?

The legal drinking age in the UAE is 21, except in the Emirate of Sharjah, where alcohol consumption is illegal. Sharjah is situated north of Dubai, about 1 hour and 45 minutes from Abu Dhabi by car. Being intoxicated in public is not permitted. Abu Dhabi has a zero-tolerance policy, and there are severe fines and penalties for those caught driving while under the influence.

### Is Abu Dhabi dangerous?

Abu Dhabi’s general crime level is very low. Random, violent criminal acts are extremely rare. As in any other city, you should be cognizant of your surroundings and personal safety as you travel.

### Is Abu Dhabi an accessible city?

Yes. Modern areas and establishments such as cultural sites, hotels, restaurants are fitted with adaptations and services for people with special needs or disabilities. Parking lots include designated spots, public spaces have been updated with proper facilities, and ramps are increasingly commonplace outside public buildings.

### What advice do you have for LGBTQ+ visitors?

The local organization team has been in touch with leaders of LGBTQ+ affinity groups to discuss how to make the venue most hospitable and answer any concerns they may have. A blog post with advice for LGBTQ+ visitors is available [here](https://coling2025.org/venue/lgbtq/).

### I have never been to the UAE before, and I have some questions about traveling there. Who can I talk to?

The local organization team is happy to answer any questions and concerns by email or schedule Zoom sessions. Please email [mailto:coling2025-programchairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:coling2025-programchairs@googlegroups.com).
