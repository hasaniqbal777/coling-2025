### Are virtual presentations supported?

The main conference is in-person only (not hybrid). However, there will be virtual presentation sessions, which will take place some time after the main conference has finished on Mon and Tue Jan 27-28, 2025; so people who attend the main conference can attend the virtual sessions more easily.
