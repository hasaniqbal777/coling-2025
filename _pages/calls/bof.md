The Social Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) chairs welcome applications for Birds of a Feather (BoF) / Affinity Group sessions and socials at COLING 2025. Would you like to organize a social or BoF session to discuss a specific theme in CL, NLP, or research in general? Submit your BoF proposals, and let us help you with this. Just fill out this short [form](https://forms.gle/8JrSBH7Gc3sgqLRBA) before **23:59 AOE,  December 20th, 2024** to submit your proposal.

BoF sessions are a great way to bring together junior and senior members of the community. We welcome submissions from potential BoF hosts of all career stages. Your primary responsibility will be hosting the session, welcoming attendees, and getting the conversation going!

*P.S. All BoF hosts should be registered for COLING 2025, and the sessions will be in-person.*
