## Paper Submission

COLING 2025 invites submissions of up to eight (8) pages maximum, excluding references, for long papers, and four (4) pages, excluding references, for short papers and system demonstrations. Upon acceptance, final versions of papers will be given one additional page – up to nine (9) pages of content, for long papers, and to five (5) pages, for short papers and system demonstrations, excluding unlimited pages for acknowledgments and references – so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.

Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system. The submission site will be announced on the conference website soon.

Submission of papers (including an anonymized preprint) mush follow the ACL Policies for Submission, Review and Citation.

In particular, when submitting an anonymized preprint version, please specify its full-path URL; the authors need to provide the full-path URL like [https://arxiv.org/abs/xxx](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxx) for a paper in arxiv.

## Style Files and Formatting

<span style="color:red">The *COLING template MUST be used for your submission(s). If not, your submission(s) will be rejected.</span>.

- All authors must follow the [general instructions for COLING 2025 proceedings](https://coling2025.org/downloads/coling-2025.pdf) which are an adaptation of (or rely on) the general instructions for *ACL proceedings, using the supplied style files.
- Style files are directly available ([LaTeX](https://coling2025.org/downloads/coling-2025.zip), [Word](https://coling2025.org/downloads/coling-2025.docx)).
- The Overleaf template will be available soon.
- It is highly recommended that appendices, which are material that can be read but are not critical, should be included in a single manuscript file, coming after the references of the main paper; In this standard guideline, both the main text and appendices should appear in a `single' manuscript file, without being separately maintained. But, authors also may place an appendix in a separate supplementary file, when the size of an appendix is too long to be included in a main PDF file.
- Please do not modify these style files, or use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.

## Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data
Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by an appendix usually being included in a main PDF paper file, one `.tgz` or `.zip` archive containing software, and one `.tgz` or `.zip` archive containing data. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into the appendix. However, the paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. If the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in the appendix. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.

## Appendices

Appendices are material that can be read, and include lemmas, formulas, proofs, and tables that are not critical to the reading and understanding of the paper, as in *[ACLPUB](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html#appendices). It is highly recommended that the appendices should come after the references; the main text and appendices should be contained in a `single` manuscript file, without being separately maintained. Letter them in sequence and provide an informative title: 
*Appendix A. Title of Appendix*.

## Extra space for ethical considerations

Please note that extra space is allowed after the 8th page (4th page for short papers) for an ethics/broader impact statement. At submission time, this means that if you need extra space for the ethical considerations section, it should be placed after the conclusion so that it is possible to rapidly check that the rest of the paper still fits in 8 pages (4 pages for short papers). Ethical considerations sections, acknowledgements, and references do not count against these limits. For camera-ready versions 9 pages of content will be allowed for long (5 for short) papers. Ethical considerations sections, acknowledgements, and references do not count against these limits.
