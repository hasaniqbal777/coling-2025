COLING 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing.

Relevant topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas:

- Dialogue and Interactive Systems
- Discourse and Pragmatics
- Document Classification and Topic Modeling
- Ethics, Bias, and Fairness
- Information Extraction
- Information Retrieval and Text Mining
- Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP
- Language Modeling
- Language Resources and Evaluation
- Linguistic Insights Derived using Computational Techniques
- Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics
- Low-Resource and Efficient Methods for NLP
- Machine Learning for Computational Linguistics and NLP
- Machine Translation and Translation Aids
- Multilingualism and Language Diversity
- Multimodal and Grounded Language Acquisition
- NLP and LLM Applications (such as Education, Healthcare, Finance, Legal NLP, Computational Social Science, etc.)
- Natural Language Generation
- Offensive Speech Detection and Analysis
- Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation
- Question Answering
- Lexical Semantics
- Sentence-level Semantics (Textual Inference, Paraphrasing, etc)
- Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, Opinion and Argument Mining
- Speech Recognition and Synthesis, and Spoken Language Understanding
- Summarization and Simplification
- Syntactic analysis (Tagging, Chunking, Parsing)
- Vision and Robotics

Papers targeting any of these topics from the perspective of the Sustainability Goals of the UN are especially welcome.

## Submission Details

COLING 2025 invites the submission of long papers of up to eight pages and short papers of up to four pages. These page limits only apply to the main body of the paper. At the end of the paper (after the conclusions but before the references) papers need to include a mandatory section discussing the limitations of the work and, optionally, a section discussing ethical considerations. Papers can include unlimited pages of references and an unlimited appendix.  Authors should follow the [general instructions for COLING 2025 proceedings](https://coling2025.org/downloads/coling-2025.pdf), which are an adaptation of the general instructions for *ACL proceedings. 

To prepare your submission, please make sure to use the COLING 2025 style files available here:

- [LaTeX](https://coling2025.org/downloads/coling-2025.zip)
- [Word](https://coling2025.org/downloads/coling-2025.docx)
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-coling-2025-proceedings/hfhcytgpqmzf)

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">Papers deviating from the provided style files will be rejected without review.</span>

COLING 2025 adopts the ACL Ethics Policy.

There are two routes for paper submission:

### Direct submission

Papers should be submitted through *Softconf/START* using the following link:
[https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/](https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/)

Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.

### ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers

Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.

## Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data

Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single `.tgz` or `.zip` archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.

Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are 11:59PM [UTC-12:00](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/timezone/utc-12) (“anywhere on Earth”).

## Anonymity Period

COLING 2025 will follow the ACL Anonymity Policy. As a result, no anonymity period will be required, although authors are still cautioned against extensive advertising. The submissions themselves must still be fully anonymized.

## Multiple Submission Policy

Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.
