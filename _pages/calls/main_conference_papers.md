## Submission Details

COLING 2025 invites the submission of long papers of up to eight pages and short papers of up to four pages. These page limits only apply to the main body of the paper. At the end of the paper, after the main body but before the references, papers need to include a mandatory section discussing the limitations of the work and, optionally, a section discussing ethical considerations. Papers can include unlimited pages of references and an unlimited appendix.  Authors must follow the two-column format of *ACL conferences. 

COLING 2025 adopts the ACL Ethics Policy.

Submissions will only be accepted in PDF format, with optional supplementary materials such as software and data. Deviations from the provided templates will result in rejection without review.

COLING 2025 will allow two routes for paper submission:

1. Direct submission: Papers submitted via this route will undergo a normal review process. Papers will be assigned to three reviewers and authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings.
2. ARR papers: Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.

The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible. 

### Anonymity Period

COLING 2025 will follow the ACL Anonymity Policy. As a result, no anonymity period will be required, although authors are still cautioned against extensive advertising. The submissions themselves must still be fully anonymized.

### Multiple Submission Policy

Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the

 conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.
