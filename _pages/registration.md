## Author Registration Requirements

- *Conference papers (main track, industry track, demos)*: At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the COLING 2025 Main Conference at the in-person fee rate by the early registration deadline, even if the paper is presented in the virtual part of the conference. Failure to register will result in the paper being excluded from the COLING 2025 Proceedings. The registration can be at the full or at the student rate.  Each registration can cover up to 2 papers. 
- *Workshop papers*:  At least one author of each paper at a workshop must register either for the full conference or for the workshop day(s) only. Workshop shared task papers do not need an author to register.

## Author Registration Deadlines

To assist the program chairs and the committee with publishing the conference details for the program and the Anthology, we ask all authors to register no later than December 23, 2024.
